8	Modeling a Character Base	Block out a simple humanoid or creature shape.
9	Sculpting Basics	        Use Dyntopo and brushes to sculpt details.
10	Retopology (Intro)	        Learn basics of simplifying sculpted models.
11	UV Unwrapping Basics	    Unwrap simple models for texturing.
12	Texture Painting	        Paint textures directly on the model or use image textures.
13	Lighting Setup	            Add lights (Point, Sun, Area) and adjust scene lighting.
14	Mini Project #2	            Model and texture a treasure chest, crate, or game prop.

Week 3: Rigging and Animation
Day	Topic	                    Task
15	Introduction to Rigging	    Add an armature to your model and create a basic bone structure.
16	Weight Painting	            Assign mesh influence to bones using weight paint.
17	Posing & FK Animation	    Create basic poses and a simple walk cycle using forward kinematics.
18	IK Rigging	                Add inverse kinematics for easier leg/arm movement.
19	Animation Timeline	        Learn keyframes, dope sheet, graph editor.
20	Camera Movement	            Animate camera tracking, zoom, or panning.
21	Mini Project #3	            Animate a simple game action (e.g., attack, jump, idle).

Week 4: Exporting & Game-Ready Workflow
Day	Topic	                    Task
22	Optimizing for Games	    Reduce poly count, apply transforms, rename objects.
23	Export to GLTF/FBX	        Learn how to export models with animations for Unity/Unreal/Godot.
24	Baking Textures & Normals	Bake normals and ambient occlusion for game use.
25	Asset Organization	        Create collections, group objects, and prepare game asset folders.
26	Game Engine Testing	        Import your model into a game engine and test the animation.
27	VFX: Particle System	    Add basic particles like smoke, sparks, or fire.
28	VFX: Shader Effects	        Create a glowing material or animated shader.
29	Final Polish	            Clean up files, organize, and finalize your best model.
30	Final Project	            Make a game-ready character or object with idle/walk animation.
